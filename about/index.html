					<h2>We Love Being Small</h2>
					<p>
					Clever Web Design, as you probably have been able to guess by now, is a different kind of web design company. We're small and we're proud of it. Being small allows us to do things others can't. We can move quickly, stay ahead of industry trends, keep up with the latest technology, and generally understand the web better than others. Clever is a small, young company run by smart young people. This puts us in a unique position to offer you the type of service that is truly rare in this industry. We're proud to say we're in a class with very few, elite firms.

					<h3>Greetings from Chicago!</h3>
					<p>
					Clever Web Design is based just outside Chicago â€“ the greatest city in the world! If you don't agree, send us an email letting us know why. While we're not in the heart of the city, we will be quite soon. Despite not being downtown, our proximity to Chicago gives us something special when it comes to the world of web design and development. We have all the skills of the Silicon Valley elite while retaining our Chicago, blue-collar, practical side that guides us to develop with a focus on providing a long-term return on investment instead of following passing industry fads.

					<h3>Meet the Founder</h3>
					<p>
					Clever isn't run by stuffy businessmen... well, it <em>is</em> run by businessmen but not the boring stuffy kind. We're a young company with young management. We have the unique advantage of being owned and staffed with young professionals who have grown up online and understand it not only from a technical standpoint but from a social perspective as well. Clever's founder, Bill Patrianakos, is no exception. Click the little green button below and learn more about Bill and the team  behind Clever Web Design.

						<h4>The Founder</h4>
						<p>
						<img class="frame left img-spc" src="../img/bill.jpg" alt="Bill Patrianakos - Founder of Clever Web Design" />
						Clever was founded by Bill Patrianakos in December of 2010. Bill studied at Loyola University Chicago, Columbia College Chicago, and finally at DeVry University majoring in Computer Science with a focus on Programming for the Web.
						</p>
						<p>
						Bill doesn't just run the business side of things - he is Clever's Lead Programmer and has an active role in day to day operations, regularly meeting with clients and doing much of the programming and strategic planning for their websites and marketing campaigns. You can learn more about Bill at <a href="http://billpatrianakos.me">his personal website</a>.

						<h4>The Clever Team</h4>
						<p>
						Clever operates differently than other companies when it comes to staffing. Our team consists of several mainstays as well as a number of other "floaters" as we like to call them. We have at all times on staff a marketing expert, back-end programmer, front-end graphic designer and code editor, and a copywriter. Clever's team is small and very close knit. We work together, play together, and always know what everyone else is working on and often have a hand in it!
						</p>

					<article class="one-quarter left last">
						<h4>Passion for the Web</h4>
						<p>
						We think mission statements are boring and disingenuous so we never wrote one but if we did it would sound something like this:
						</p>
						<p>
						<span class="mission">
						"We're passionate about web development. Programming and getting noticed on the web isn't a job but an obsession! It's one part art form and one part science. The interaction between technologies, the programmers, and users of the internet is fascinating. The possibilities the web holds for us are endless and we're excited to explore those possibilities while working in the medium we love."

					<h5>What to expect</h5>
					<p>
					When you work with Clever much of the process is fairly predictable. Here's a quick run down of how the process works for our web design and app development services:
					</p>
					<ul id="process">
						<li><span class="step">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>First Contact</strong>
						<br /><br />
						When you first call we'll want you to explain in your own words what you have in mind. If you're not quite sure what you're looking for that's okay too. We'll ask you a few more questions while we take notes and, if we can, give you a ballpark estimate of what the cost would be and our general approach to your project. We'll then ask to schedule a meeting with you in the next 5 to 7 days.<br />&nbsp;</li>
						<li><span class="step">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Research and Proposal</strong>
						<br /><br />
						During that time we'll be putting together a formal proposal based on our previous conversation with you. Our proposal outlines a minimum of three different approaches to the same project which you get to then choose from according to which one best suits your goals and budget.<br />&nbsp;</li>
						<li><span class="step">3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Terms and Agreement</strong>
						<br /><br />
						Once you've chosen which solution makes sense to you, we'll put in writing exactly what we promised and then begin the work. Before we begin, however, we will ask for a portion of the cost as a deposit.<br />&nbsp;</li>
						<li><span class="step">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Our Work is in Your Hands</strong>
						<br /><br />
						We'll be in touch regularly during the course of the work. We'll get your opinions and input while we bring the project together. When the work is finished we'll hand over the completed project, set up live online, and even show you how to use your new website and any tools we've set up for you in addition to the instruction manuals we provide.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Skills and abilities</h5>
					<p>
					We're experts in web media. That means both content creation and marketing. Our biggest strength is our modern techniques. The world of web technologies is fast paced and those who can't keep up get left behind. That's the reason you see so many larger web design companies failing these days. They learned what they know back in the late to mid 90's, got set in their ways, and now their quickly falling behind. Everyone here at Clever Web Design is not only trained in modern web standards and best practices but must learn a new skill every six months and apply that skill to a personal project. At the end of each year we all vote on who built the coolest web app and they get a prize (this year's prize is an iPad2). 
					</p>
					<img src="../img/technology.png" alt="Modern Technology">
					<h6>Masters in the art of...</h6>
					<p>
					We specialize in the use of </em>modern</em> web standards. That's not just a buzz word we use to sell our wares, it's the truth. Everything we set out to work on is built with the future in mind. We ask ourselves questions like "Is this design trendy or will it still look good in 5 years?" and "How can I leverage new code specs to make this design actually become more impressive as time goes on?" or "How will the evolution of mobile browsers affect the layout and load times of this site in the future?". We're masters in HTML5, CSS3, PHP, MySQL, Ruby (and Rails), JavaScript, and more. On top of that we're constantly adding to the list of languages we develop in. That means you take home a product that is built to last and won't need to be redesigned in a few years time.
