					<h2>What we're looking for</h2>
					<p>
					As a small startup in the technology sector we know that traditional qualifications are often meaningless. Here at Clever we aren't necessarily looking for Harvard grads, Yale grads, or even graduates at all in some cases. Our focus is on your skill and experience no matter where or how you got them. If you got your skills in college, that's great! If you got them while tinkering by yourself for the past five years, well that's equally impressive. We're looking for the person who can get the job done, not the person who can drop the most names on their resume.

				<h3>Positions</h3>
				<article class="one-third left">
					<h3>Co-founder wanted</h3>
					<p>
					For over a year now Bill has been running Clever by himself. The company has grown by leaps and bounds in that year. Imagine how much more can get done with a cofounder on board!
					</p>
					<p>
					<strong>Qualifications</strong>
					<br />
					Anyone wanting to become a stakeholder in this company needs to be dedicated to all things web programming, have broad knowledge of most aspects of web development, and must have a great personality. Candidates to be cofounder will be expected to be involved in all aspects of the business and be will willing to invest time, money, and a lot of energy into making Clever the most sought-after digital marketing agency in the Chicago area.

				<article class="one-third left">
					<h3>Design Artist</h3>
					<p>
					An ideal Design Artist would be comfortable using Photoshop or Illustrator to create custom graphics for our clients and UI elements for the sites we build. This person should specialize in either graphic design or web design and be familiar and comfortable using the latest HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript techniques to design <em>modern</em> user interfaces for both desktop and mobile platforms.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article class="one-third left last">
					<h3>Code Writer (A.K.A. Programmer)</h3>
					<p>
					We need a programmer to help build custom web applications and get online stores running smoothly. Our ideal Code Writer would be well versed in PHP above all with a good grasp of object-oriented coding principles. Languages this person should know: PHP, Ruby (and Rails preferably), JavaScript. Should be right at home working with database applications. Solid AJAX, REST, and JSON knowledge gets you automatically hired. Also, we use Git, so definitely be ready to work with it as your default VCS.

					<h3>What we're about</h3>
					<p>
					<strong>In the beginning</strong><br />
					Clever began solely as a web design firm that moved into web marketing and is now a full-service Digital Marketing Agency. We're all about the new way things are done online. If you work with Clever as a team member or a client you should know that we ride the trends - the trends that last. While everyone else is still designing sites using old, outdated techniques and tools, we should be delivering cutting edge designs, effective marketing strategies, and products that will still be fresh five years from now which is an eternity online.
					</p>
					<p>
					<strong>Focus on the future</strong><br />
					We're also about the open web. We contribute to open source projects, create our own, and use open technologies over old, slow, proprietary beasts. You won't find us developing in ASP.NET here, nor will we be using Microsoft IIS servers for anything. We give our clients something they can take anywhere else and still be confident that it will run like a champ and that any other programmer could easily pick it apart.
					</p>
					<p>
					<strong>More than service</strong><br />
					On the surface we may come off as a B2B service company but we're much more than that. We're ready to pivot when the time is right with a number of side projects that will launch in the near future. We want great people to help us build these apps. When you become a part of Clever it should be more than just a job. We want you to be an integral part of the company. We're small. That means you have a voice in the direction we go, the policies we implement, and the management of the company. We don't want employees, we want a team with a vested interest in seeing the company they're a part of grow.
					</p>

					<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
					<p>
					We're ready to admit that we're small and have scarce resources as a bootstrapping startup. What we do have, however, is something you'll rarely find elsewhere. So what's in it for you? Freedom. As part of the Clever team you have the freedom to work on your own time. No punchin in. No time tracking. Compensation is based on a per-job basis. You work where you want. We do have meetings and will require you to live close enough to commute for meetings. Otherwise you get to telecommute. You have freedom as to how you do your job. We won't tell you how to write your code or how to design your site. We all work within the limits given to use by the client and beyond that get to implement what we believe is right for the job.
